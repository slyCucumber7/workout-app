This project is a workout tracker application designed to be lightweight and efficient. The application is built in Java, and attempts to follow the Maven file structure.
It leverages the JavaFX library for an intuitive and responsive graphical user interface and uses serialization to achieve data persistence.
Through this project, I sought to deepen my understanding of event-driven programming, data persistence, UI/UX design principles, and software architecture strategies.
